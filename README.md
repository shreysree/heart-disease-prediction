# heart-disease-prediction
The objective of this project is to be able to accurately classify as having or not 
having heart disease based on diagnostic test data. We have made use of the 
Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease dataset which contains 13 variables related to 
patient diagnostics and one outcome variable indicating the presence or absence 
of heart disease. We have used logistic regression to make prediction regarding 
heart disease.
